A simple example of JSON and JAXB usage.

Object identity matters. The sample object graph contains object with multiple references to them (although no loops).

JAXB can handle this using XmlID and XmlIDREF.
Jackson JSON cannot (as of 1.9.4) and instead serializes a new copy for each reference to the same object.
